                <h2>UI/UX Designer</h2>
                <p>I am an active student at BINUS @Bandung University,
                    currently in
                    my 7th semester. I have a strong interest and passion in the
                    field of UI/UX Development, with Figma as my primary tool
                    for design processes. In addition, I have experience in teaching,
                    organizational activities, and technical skills in various programming
                    languages and relevant design tools.

                    <p>The Museum Art Apps project is a part of a DataAbase
                        course assignment aimed at fulfilling the final
                        grade
                        requirements. The app's features include a ticket
                        sales
                        list, customer data management, and data deletion.
                        This
                        application simplifies administrative tasks for
                        museum
                        administrators, enabling them to efficiently handle
                        customer information and ticket transactions. For

                    <h3>Lung Prediction Cancer</h3>
                    <p>The Lung Cancer Prediction Apps is designed to assist
                        the general public in performing preliminary lung
                        health checks. Users can utilize this app to
                        determine whether they might have lung cancer or
                        not. Currently, the application is still in the form
                        of an interactive mockup. You can find the link to
                        the mockup here: <a
